            <h2>Sustainability Initiatives</h2>
            <p>Team Ryu is committed to sustainability and has implemented several initiatives to promote environmental responsibility. We have conducted assemblies at our school to reduce paper waste and encourage the use of metal cups instead of disposable paper cups.</p>
            <p>Our BYOC (Bring Your Own Cup) initiative encourages students and staff to bring metal cups from home, reducing reliance on single-use paper cups provided by the school. This effort is part of our broader commitment to minimizing environmental impact and fostering a culture of sustainability.</p>
